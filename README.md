## Installation

Use the package manager [go](https://golang.org/doc/install) to install foobar.

```bash

Install the Go tools
If you are upgrading from an older version of Go you must first remove the existing version.

Linux, macOS, and FreeBSD tarballs
Download the archive and extract it into /usr/local, creating a Go tree in /usr/local/go. For example:

tar -C /usr/local -xzf go$VERSION.$OS-$ARCH.tar.gz
Choose the archive file appropriate for your installation. For instance, if you are installing Go version 1.2.1 for 64-bit x86 on Linux, the archive you want is called go1.2.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz.

(Typically these commands must be run as root or through sudo.)

Add /usr/local/go/bin to the PATH environment variable. You can do this by adding this line to your /etc/profile (for a system-wide installation) or $HOME/.profile:

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin

To use go must be installed.

You can uncomment the first lines he will downloads.

It is not installed uncomment the dependent lines at the beginning of the code to download the scripts.

The code can be changed to the wordlist to make recons of subdomains, adding your directory.

Need to add your shodan apy key on line 121.
